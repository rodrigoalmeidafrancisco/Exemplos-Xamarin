# Your App Shell

This template uses Shell, an app container that reduces the complexity of your apps by providing fundamental features including:

- A single place to describe the app's visual hierarchy.
- Common navigation such as a flyout menu and tabs.
- A URI-based navigation scheme that permits navigation to any page in the application.
- An integrated search handler.
